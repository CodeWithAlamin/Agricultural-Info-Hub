            <p>
              First, you need to get your seeds from a good source. I prefer
              online seed stores that accept PayPal, but this is just my
              personal preference. You can find tomato seeds in the garden
              center at places like Wal-Mart and Lowes. I buy mine from
              Tomatobob.com, who sells only heirloom seeds.
              <br />
              <br />
              Research the seed company you are buying from to make sure they
              are reputable and that you will get good seeds from them. I'm an
              heirloom grower, but you can choose to grow either heirlooms,
              hybrids, or some of each.

            <h2 class="text-success mt-5">When to Plant the Seeds</h2>

            <p>
              Tomatoes are typically sown 6 to 8 weeks before the last
              anticipated frost. Some say to sow them later, more like 5 weeks
              before the last frost, but either will work. Keep in mind that the
              earlier you start, the larger the plants will be when you plant
              them out.
              <br />
              <br />

              To find your average last frost date, go to
              <a
                href="http://http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/climatenormals/climatenormals.pl?directive=prod_select2&prodtype=CLIM2001&subrnum%20to%20Freeze/Frost%20Data%20from%20the%20U.S.%20Climate%20Normals"

              I live in Middle Tennessee and start my seeds in mid- to
              late-February.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
            <h2 class="text-success mt-5">Start the Seeds</h2>

            <p>
              Use seed starting mix, such as Miracle Gro or Jiffy Mix, to start
              your seeds. Fill a bowl with some mix and knead in some water till
              the mix is saturated but not soggy.
              <br />
              <br />

              I use egg cartons to start my seeds in. You can use either the
              clear plastic or Styrofoam cartons; do NOT use the paper ones.
              Fill the trays with seed mix and firm the mix down into the cells.
              <br />
              <br />

              If you are growing multiple varieties, you will need a labeling
              system to keep track of what tray contains what variety. Use tape,
              plant tags, etc to mark the trays. Be creative - do whatever works
              best for you to keep track of the varieties. Plant the seeds about
              1/4 inch deep, 2 seeds per cell. I use a pencil with the tip
              broken off to make a 1/4" deep hole in the center of each cell,
              and I drop 2 seeds into each hole and firm the mix around the
              seeds to completely cover them.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
            <h2 class="text-success mt-5">Germination</h2>

            <p>
              Keep your trays moist and warm to speed germination. Loosely fit
              plastic wrap over the tops of the trays, to keep water in but
              still allow for air circulation. Light is not required to
              germinate seeds.
              <br />
              <br />

              In anywhere from 3 to 15 days, you should start to see tiny
              seedlings emerge. When your seedlings are up and the first 2
              leaves (cotyledon leaves) start to open, you will need to put your
              seedlings under a light. Use a cheap fluorescent shop light for
              your seedlings. I use 4' fixtures that take 2 bulbs each. You can
              use regular fluorescent tubes, or ones specially made for plants.
              I use GE "Plant & Aquarium" tubes in my fixtures.
              <br />
              <br />

              It's very important to keep your seedlings within 4" of the
              lights, preferably closer. If you keep the light too far from the
              seedlings, they will get very "leggy" - tall and skinny - and
              might collapse. Keep the seed starting mix moist but not soggy,
              and water whenever the surface becomes dry to the touch (but NOT
              completely dry).

            <h2 class="text-success mt-5">Care for the Young Seedlings</h2>

            <p>
              Keep the seedlings watered - not overwatered, but don't let them
              get so dry they wilt, either.
              <br />
              <br />

              Make sure they are kept within 4" of the grow light(s). You can
              adjust the chain that the light hangs from, or you can put the
              seedling trays on books or boxes to adjust their distance from the
              light.
              <br />
              <br />

              Make sure your grow light setup is in a room where it won't get
              too hot (80+ deg F) or too cold (below 50 deg F). You will want
              the seedlings to be easily accessible, because you will be
              watering them often (every couple days). Monitor your seedlings
              and make sure they are growing well. The cotyledon leaves should
              grow up to 1 inch wide each, and should be a healthy green color.
              Damping off can be a problem - this is a disease that causes young
              plants to collapse at the soil line and die. If any of your
              seedlings damp off, remove the infected plants and the mix they
              grew in to prevent spreading the disease to other plants.

          <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
            <h2 class="text-success mt-5">Care for the Young Seedlings</h2>

            <p>
              When your tomato seedlings are showing their first set of true
              leaves, it's time to put them in individual pots. I use 16-ounce
              disposable plastic cups. These work well and are cheap. Fill the
              cups with Miracle Gro Potting Mix or similar potting mix. I use
              Miracle Gro because it eliminates the need to apply fertilizer
              manually. Use a pencil to make a hole in the center of the mix in
              each cup. The hole should be about 1 inch wide and 3-4 inches
              deep. Choose the best seedlings to pot up, and discard the rest.
              If you pot up more than you can grow in your garden, just give
              away the extra plants when they are bigger. Carefully loosen the
              seed starting mix around your chosen seedlings. Gently scoop out
              each seedling, being careful not to damage the roots or stem. Tap
              off excess mix from the roots so they will fit easily into the
              hole you
              <br />
              <br />
              made in the mix in the larger cups. Do this one at a time, and
              when a seedling has been uprooted, put it in the larger cup
              immediately. Firm the potting mix around the roots and the stem of
              each seedling. Bury the stem all the way up to the cotyledon
              leaves - roots will grow from the stem and benefit the plant.
              Label your cups with the variety name of each plant. I write on
              the side of the cup with a Sharpie. Thoroughly water all the cups.
              Make sure you don't splash potting mix all over the seedlings when
              you water them. When the seedlings are all potted up, put them
              under the grow light(s) and keep them within 4-5 inches of the
              lights.

            <h2 class="text-success mt-5">Planting Out</h2>

            <p>
              When the danger of frost has passed, it's time to get the plants
              out in the garden. Your garden should be tilled ahead of time, and
              adding compost is good. Soil pH should be from 6 to 7 (slightly
              acidic to neutral) for tomatoes. Dig a trench about 1 foot long,
              with one end deeper than the other. Carefully remove the plant
              from its pot and loosen the root ball. Place the root ball in the
              deeper end of the trench, and lay the seedling on its side with
              the stem in the trough. Remove all the leaves from the part of the
              stem that is in the trench, and leave the top few leaves on where
              they will be above the ground. Bury the roots and bare stem in the
              trench, leaving only the top few leaves sticking out. Don't worry
              about their being sideways - the plant will correct itself and
              grow upwards within a few days.
              <br />
              <br />

              Trenching plants allows roots to develop along the entire buried
              portion of the stem. They say this increases yields - I haven't
              done any tests of my own but it makes sense. More roots allow for
              more nutrients to be absorbed. Repeat the trenching process to all
              your plants, keeping them spaced at least 2 feet apart (if you
              plan on pruning) or 3-4 feet apart (if you won't be pruning). When
              all the plants are trenched, water them thoroughly and add mulch
              if desired. Drive stakes or cages into the ground, making sure you
              don't puncture the buried stem.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
            <h2 class="text-success mt-5">Care in the Garden</h2>

            <p>
              Your tomato growing spot should receive at least 6 hours of sun a
              day for good yields. I only get at most 5 hours a day, but my
              plants sill produce fairly well. Keep the plants watered, but not
              overwatered. Don't let them dry out or inconsistently water them.
              Not enough water can cause fruit problems like Blossom End Rot,
              and overwatering can cause the fruit to crack.
              <br />
              <br />

              To prune your plants, pinch off the suckers (shoots that come out
              from between each leaf and the main stem). You can let a few
              suckers grow for more fruit per plant, but as a general rule, the
              more fruit you allow, the smaller they will be. Last year I let
              one sucker grow on each plant for a total of 2 stems per plant.
              The rest of the suckers were pinched off as they grew. If you
              prune your plants, tie the stems to a stake. If you don't prune
              them, you can let them sprawl on the ground or place tomato cages
              around the plants.

          <div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
            <h2 class="text-success mt-5">Harvest</h2>

            <p>
              You should start getting ripe fruit anywhere from 2 to 4 months
              after planting out in the garden. Different varieties have
              different DTM (days to maturity), so some will ripen 70 days after
              transplanting and some will ripen late, 100 days or more. Usually
              when you purchase seed, the description will tell you the DTM.
              <br />
              <br />

              You can cut or twist the fruit off when it is fully colored. Some
              heirloom varieties ripen green or have green shoulders when ripe;
              Google the varieties you are growing to see what they look like
              when ripe.
              <br />
              <br />

              From this point forward, it's mostly watering and picking fruit
              till the season ends.
